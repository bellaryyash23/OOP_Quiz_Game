# Quiz Game based on Object Oriented Programming.
Created a quiz game with the project distributed into different files and implemented using specific classes for specific tasks.
In the program, the data.py file holds the quiz question data bank. The question model file contains Question class which structures the questions in proper format.
The quizz_brain.py is truely the brain of the Quiz. It performs the task of Updating questions, Keeping track of user score and track of questions asked.
All this is implemented by the use of QuizzBrain class and its correspoding methods.
The main.py brings all this code into action by importing and exporting data and arguments within the above mentioned classes.
